###Final Project at Makers Academy

For our final project at [Makers Academy](http://www.makersacademy.com/) we choose to follow the idea of Bernard, Flicky Notes.
Flicky Notes is a meeting app which allows you to write your own notes on a mobile device and then, with a simple swipe movement, send it to the board on your desktop.

###How to use

Visit the website [http://flickynotes.meteor.com](http://flickynotes.meteor.com) on your computer AND your smartphone.
Follow the onscreen instructions to use the app.

###Achievements

One of the biggest challenges we've faced is learning a new framework, Meteor, which works with a non-SQL database called MongoDB. It was a really nice experience to be able to share all of our ideas and create such a powerful application in just 2 weeks.
We've spent a lot of time figuring out how the velocity testing framework worked. Funnily enough, the version 1.0 we used had to be rolled back while we were working on it. 

###To do:
We have plenty of ideas to make this project grow and we are planning to spend time on it even after Makers ends.
A few functions that we'd like to add to the app are:
- sign up and sign in for users
- profile of each user with the list of boards
- a user should be able to create a board with a number of columns
- a user should be able to add collaborators
- customizable board and flicky notes
- create native apps for iOS and Android

###Technology used
- Meteor
- MongoDB
- Node.js
- Velocity
- Jasmine
