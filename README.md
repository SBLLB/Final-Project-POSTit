###Final Project at Makers Academy

For our final project at [Makers Academy](http://www.makersacademy.com/) we choose to follow the idea of Bernard, Flicky Notes.
Flicky Notes is a meeting app which allows you to write your own notes on a mobile device and then, with a simple swipe movement, send it to the board on your desktop.

###Achivements

First of all we've learned a new framework, Meteor, which works with a non-SQL database called MongoDB. It was a really nice experience to be able to share all of our ideas and craete such a powerfull application, in just 2 weeks.
We've spent a lot of time finguring out how velocity testing framework (for Meteor) worked; funny fact is that velocity version 1.0 was rollback while we were working on it.
