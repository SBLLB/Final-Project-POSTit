###Final Project at Makers Academy

For our final project at [Makers Academy](http://www.makersacademy.com/) we choose the project proposed by Bernard, Flicky Notes.
Flicky Notes is a meeting app which allows you to write your own notes on a mobile device and then, with a simple swipe movement, send it to the board on your desktop.
